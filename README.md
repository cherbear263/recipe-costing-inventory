# Nuxt 3 Recipe Costing App

- can add a recipe
- will look up ingredients in inventory
- can calculate the cost of the recipe (though I think I need ot chnage htis system)

## To do

- upload the recipe to the database
- view recipes
- edit recipes
- fillings and other recipes should be added to the inventory (e.g. if you were to make a ham and cheese croissant you would need to have enough home-made croissants!)
- I wonder if I should make the calculate cost exist in a store so that I can access it anywhere?
